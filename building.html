            <h2>Farms</h2>
            <p>Farms are an essential building in Dragon City, as it serves as one of the player's main source of Food. Players can plant Crops by spending Gold, and when they eventually grow, they can be harvested for Food and XP. As the player levels up, upgrades for Farms are unlocked, which provides the player with greater varieties of Crops to plant. <br><br>Each Crop type in the Farm has a counterpart which are only accessible to players who are in an Alliances. These Crops cost the same in Gold and grants the same amount of XP as the original, but yield higher amounts of Food.</p>

            <h2>Crystals</h2>
            <p>Crystals are a building in Dragon City, which affect dragons of the same type within a 10 and a half tiles radius and can be placed anywhere on the map. They grant a 20% increase in gold production for all dragons of the matching element in any Habitat within the radius. A dragon can receive boosts from multiple crystals, as they only need to have the same element as the crystal's element. Also, double element dragons will get twice the boost of the corresponding Crystal (since they have 2 times the same element). For example, the Double Terra Dragon and Double Flame Dragon will get 40% gold boost from a single "Terra Crystal" and "Flame Crystal", respectively. However, not all elements have their own crystal boost.</p>
