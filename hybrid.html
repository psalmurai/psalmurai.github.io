        <h1>Hybrid Dragons</h1>
        <p>Hybrid Dragons (Hybrids) are Dragons possessing more than one Element. The first Element of a Dragon is called the Primary/Defending Element. The Primary/Defending Element determines its type (e.g., the Flaming Rock Dragon is called a Terra Hybrid) and is used for damage calculation in Battles. The remaining Elements (Secondary Elements) of a Dragon determines what type of attacks it is capable of, and what type of attacks it can be trained in.</p>
