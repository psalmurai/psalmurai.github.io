            <h1>Island</h1>
            <p>In the enchanted world of Dragon City, vast floating islands serve as sanctuaries for dragons. Shaped by ancient magic, these islands come in varied forms, making it impossible to perfectly use all the space. Early on, players build small Habitats, each taking 4x4 spaces, but as their power grows, they unlock larger 6x6 Habitats to house their mighty dragons. As the number of dragons increased, the original islands could no longer contain them all. <br><br>In response, the magic of Dragon City expanded, revealing the hidden Desert Island and Skull Island to the bravest players. As the skies continued to shift, more islands appeared—Rainbow Island, with its radiant beauty, Ice Island, frozen in eternal winter, and the mysterious Gothic Island, shrouded in shadow. These mystical realms were unlocked only when all previous lands were claimed. In time, the cosmic forces of the game unveiled Rune Island, Future Island, and the celestial Moon Island. With these new lands, the number of dragon habitats grew, allowing for even greater collections of rare and powerful creatures. <br><br> To celebrate the 10th anniversary of Dragon City, three legendary islands emerged from the mist—Tempest Island, swirling with stormy skies, Jurassic Island, teeming with ancient power, and Chronos Island, a realm where time itself bends. Each new island holds untold secrets, waiting to be discovered by those brave enough to master them!</p>
