        <h1>Pure Dragons</h1>
        <p>The Pure element was, originally, the only element to have no weaknesses against any element or deal strong damage against them. It was also dealt weak damage to Pure Element by itself each other. Now this element had been re-designated to pure attacks, which are critical against Legend Hybrids prior to the Dragon City 10th Birthday Update. Later, after Primal, Wind, and Time Elements were introduced, Pure Element is now strong against Wind Hybrids and weak against Primal Hybrids.</p>
